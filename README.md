# occluded-object-detection-with-tracking

A project from a computer vision course that focuses on detecting and tracking occluded objects in video sequences.

## Requirements

    Python 3
    OpenCV
    NumPy
    

## Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine and run the following command:

python occluded_object_detection.py

## Results

The program outputs a video with the occluded objects marked with bounding boxes and their tracking trajectory.

## Notes

The project uses a combination of object detection and object tracking algorithms to achieve its results. The object detection is done using the Haar cascade classifier, while the object tracking is done using the CAMShift algorithm.

This is just a basic implementation and can be improved by using more advanced object detection and tracking algorithms for better results.
